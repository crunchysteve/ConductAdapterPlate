## Giant Conduct to Any Stem Adapter Plate

#### WARNING: Giant's documentation express warns that usage of the Conduct master cylinder on any stem, other than Giant's specifically stated stems, will void the warranty. Giant and I both warn that mullet hacks like this one may be dangerous and could potentially cause serious injury or death. I say that, if you undertake your version of this, use the highest quality hardware and materials and that *YOU MUST* accept full personal responsibility for any risk or harm arising from using it in a live riding environment.

### In The Beginning

I have a favourite road bike with cable disk brakes. I want to upgrade to hydraulic, which I sort of had with TRP Hy/Rd cable/hydro hybrid callipers. Trouble is, I've also just recently electrified to bike with a front wheel kit and had to replace the front caliper with my stock Tektro cable pulled brake. The modulation is like "poo." Luckily, I have a pair of Tektro hydraulic callipers from a discarded mountain bike, found in the bushes near a local railway station. They are, in fact, about the only part of that old 26er worth keeping and they're the same form-factor as my awful Tektro Novello that's currently doing front stopping duty and will fit in the available "space" between the fork and the motor hub.

Remember, I said "road bike"? I have MicroSHIFT R9 levers to match my Shimano 9-speed but they're cable pull...

### What To Do?

I found a Giant Conduct master cylinder on eBay. These are a faceplate designed specifically for Giant's road bike stems to allow them to use cheaper levers for OEM but still fit hydraulic brakes on their budget gravel bikes. I could have bought a Giant stem as well, but I have a very nice Merocca suspension stem that I will die defending. (Gear snobs need not reply.)

And there is problem number two. There is no ISO headset bolt pattern standard. Anybody can make their proprietary headset and faceplate any size they want to. A Fox will not fit a Merocca, will not fit a Giant Connect, will not fit a Ritchey, and so on.

So, this is my solution - this adapter plate, longer bar clamp bolts and 4 spacers of approximately 15 to 20mm length, depending on the stem's faceplate thickness. The bolt holes at...
	- x = -15 and 15 mm and,
	- y = -21 and 21,
...are to suit my Merocca sprung stem, your dimensions will probably be different, depending on your stem. The holes at...
	- x = -12 and 12 mm and,
	- y = 0 and 42,
...are for the Conduct master cylinder and won't change. As the master cylinder is not doing handle locking duties, these holes can be tapped to M4 threads. The stem bolt holes must allow your stem's M4 or M5 bolts clearance.

### Making The Adapter Plate

![Adapter Plate Dimension Sketch](https://github.com/crunchysteve/ConductAdapterPlate/assets/46626696/76467b52-0314-4adf-af05-9999877c22c2)

Depending on your stem's bar clamp width, 50mm x 3mm aluminium bar may be adequate, but I'd seriously recommend 4mm, or even 5mm thickness, if your local supplier has it. You may need to 60mm width if your horizontal bolt spacing is wider than 42mm. The length you will need is your vertical bolt spacing, plus half the Conduct's vertical bolt spacing, plus 20mm. In my case, my peice of aluminium will be cut to 85mm by 50mm x 3mm. 8mm to 10mm edge clearance should be more than enough but, if you want less, then definitely use thicker bar and, even at 6mm, don't use less than 5mm edge spacing.

Next, especially if using thicker than 3mm for you plate, drill the Conduct mounting holes to 3mm diameter and tap them to M4 thread. If you can't tap your holes, your spacers will need to be a little longer to accommodate M4 Nylok nuts over the stem faceplate. It's better to use the thicker flat bar for this reason alone. Tapped holes allow for shorter screws, therefor shorter spacers and maybe even for shorter stem bolts, increasing handlebar clamping strength. This also makes installing the assembly a little easier, too as the master cylinder can be fitted last.

### The Spacers

These will need to be, at least, 1.6mm wall steel tubing with an internal diameter for M4 or M5 bolts depending on your stem's clamping bolt diameter. The length of the spacers must be uniform and enough for the adapter (and any nuts on the back of it) to sit just clear of your stem's faceplate. In most cases, 20mm should be adequate. The wall thickness should be at least 1.6mm for steal or 2mm to 2.5mm for aluminium tube, but not so thick that your outside diameter is larger than the diameter of your stem's stock faceplate bolts, or they may not sit right on your stem's faceplate. If the tubing you can get is too wide for your faceplate's bolt seats, you may be able to place the tubing in a drill and file it down until it just fits the bolt seat.

If you can find stock spacers that fit your faceplate and faceplate bolts, especially if steel, grab them! An alternative spacing system might be M5 threaded spacers which may not be too hard to find in 302 stainless steel. However, these may need turning down at the faceplate end to snuggly fit the bolt seat. The advantage of this method is that you don't have to loosen your bars to work on the brakes, only if you need to remove your handlebars for any reason. When torquing the nuts, this latter method may not transfer the torque fully along the entire thread.

I cannot stress enough that the spacers *NEED* to be as short as is possible, but *NOT* allowing the adapter plate or master cylinder screws to touch the faceplate. For me, this is 12mm but your length may vary. Forces you apply at your brake levers will apply sideways force on the stem bolts and this could cause them to eventually break. When selecting your longer head stem bolts, select the highest quality you can find. Torque them well, but not beyond recommended for your stem or the bolts themselves. The spacers must be cut perfectly square to share the lateral applied forces with the bolts used.

### About Giant Conduct Master Cylinders

The Conduct braking system allows the use of cable-pull levers with hydraulic disk brakes. This means, if you already have "analog" levers and don't want to upgrade everything all over the bike all at once, you can use your existing levers and upgrade your calipers alone. Or, you could convert your existing flat bar bike to drop bars without having to upgrade the entire groupset.

While being a sort of universal adapter, it is specifically designed to work with specific models of Giant head stem, and Giant warn in their manual for this part that use with any other stem system *WILL* void the warranty for the part. I have sourced mine secondhand, as they're not available in my country as a replacement part, unless being replaced on or after warranty on an actual Giant bicycle that had one as stock fitment. Some places in the world they can be sourced as off-the-shelf spare parts. There are regular appearances of secondhand units on eBay as some Giant owners choose to upgrade to Shimano 105 or similar, leaving bike shops with a pile of these things that they can't fit for liability reasons.

I stress again, if you are not experienced in bike maintenance and basic workshop practices, *DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME!* If you do proceed to do this, the risk and responsibility is yours alone. You may be breaking local laws and you may risk "breaking your neck," as my grandmother would have called it. If you proceed to trying it, you implicitly, by doing so, agree to release me of liability and hold me harmless in your case.

In my own case, this is expressly intended as a trial installation to see if it can stand up to daily commuting and light gravel riding. I make no recommendation, express or implied, that you should also conduct this experiment. If you do, it is your decision and yours alone. I also promise you, unless you meet Giant's warranty standards with your install, you *WON'T* get homologation from the scrutineers on race day! Definitely *DO NOT* try my hack on your racing bike!
